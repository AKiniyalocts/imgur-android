# imgur-android
 A basic upload tutorial using imgur API v3 on Android. Select an image via an intent, then upload that image. If your upload is successful, a link to your uploaded file will be displayed. I'm assuming you follow the official API instructions from imgur: https://api.imgur.com/

## Configuration
Just about everything you need is setup for you. Import the project into Android Studio 4.2

## Architecture
The project uses the following dependencies for various things:
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) dependency management
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) rest API 
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) background processesing
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) JSON serialization
- [Databinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/)
